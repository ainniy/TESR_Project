         <strong>The Boy, 1980</strong>
      </h3>
      <p>
         <q>Looks like rain,</q>
         <a>you</a> mutter to <a>yourself</a>.</p>
      <p>
         <q>
            <i>What'll we do if it really chucks it down?</i>
         </q>
      </p>
      <p>
         <a>you</a> open <a>your</a> eyes so that only a slender crack of light seeps in, and peer at the gingko trees in front of the <a>Provincial Office</a>.
                    As though there, between those branches, the wind is about to take on visible form. As though the raindrops suspended in the air, held breath before the plunge, are on the cusp of trembling down, glittering like jewels.</p>
      <p>When <a>you</a> open <a>your</a> eyes properly, the trees' outlines dim and blur. <a>you</a>'re going to need glasses before long.
                    This thought gets briefly disturbed by the whooping and applause that breaks out from the direction of the fountain. Perhaps <a>you</a> sight's as bad now as it's going to get, and <a>you</a>'ll be able to get away without glasses after all?</p>
      <p>
         <q>
            <i>Listen to me if <a>you</a> know what's good for <a>you</a>: come back home, right this mintue.</i>
         </q>
      </p>
      <p>
         <a>you</a> shake <a>your</a> head, trying to rid <a>yourself</a> of the memory, the anger lacing <a>your</a> brother's voice.
                    From the speakers in front of the fountain comes the clear, crisp voice of the young woman holding microphone. <a>You</a> can't see the fountain from where <a>you</a>'re sitting, on the steps leading up to the municipal gymnasium.
                    <a>You</a>'d have to go around to the right of the building if <a>you</a> wanted to have even a distant view of the memorial service. Instead, <a>you</a> resolve to stay where <a>you</a> are, and simply listen.</p>
      <p>
         <q>Brothers and sisters, our loved ones are being brought here today from the <a>Red Cross Hospital</a>.</q>
      </p>
      <p>The woman then leads the crowd gathered in the square in a chorus of the national anthem. Her voice is soon lost in the multitude, thousands of voices piling up on top of one another, a soaring tower of sound rearing up into the sky. The melody surges to peak, only to swing down again like a pendulum. The low murmur of <a>your</a> own voice is barely audible.</p>
      <p>This morning, when <a>you</a> asked how many dead were being transferred from the <a>Red Cross Hospital</a> today, <a>Jin-Su</a>'s reply was no more elaborate than it needed to be:thirty. While the leaden mass of the anthem's refrain rises and falls, rises and falls, thirty coffins will be lifted down from the truck, one by one.
                    They will be placed in a row next to the twenty-eight that <a>you</a> and <a>Jin-Su</a> laid out this morning, the line stretching all the wat from the gym to the fountain. Before yesterday evening, twenty-six of the eighty-three coffins hadn't yet been brought out for a group memorial service; yesterday evening this number had grown to twenty-eight, when two families had appeared and each identified a corpse.
                    These were then placed in coffins, with a necessarily hasty and improvised version of the usual rites. After making a note of their names and coffin numbers in <a>your</a> ledger, <a>you</a> added "group memorial service" in parentheses;<a>Jin-Su</a> had asked <a>you</a> to make a clear record of which coffins had already gone through the service, to prevent the same ones being brought out twice.
                    <a>you</a>'d wanted to go and watch, just this one time, but <a>he</a> told <a>you</a> to stay at the gym.</p>
      <p>
         <q>Someone might come looking for a relative while the service is going on. We need someone manning the doors.</q>
      </p>
      <p>Left on <a>your</a> own, <a>you</a> sit down on the steps that lead up to the gym, resting the ledger, an improvised thing whose cover is a piece of black strawboard bent down the middle, on <a>your</a> knee.The chill from the concrete steps leaches through <a>your</a> thin tracksuit bottoms.
                    <a>Your</a> PE jacket is buttoned up to the top, and <a>you</a> keep <a>your</a> arms firmly folded across <a>your</a> chest.</p>
      <p>The anthem is over, but there seems to be some delay with the coffins. Perhaps there are just too many. The sound of wailing sobs is faintly audible amid the general commotion. The woman holding microphone suggests they all sing <q>
            <i>Arirang</i>
         </q> while they wait for the coffins to be got ready.</p>
      <p>
         <i>You who abandoned me here</i>
      </p>
      <p>
         <i>Your feet will pain you before you've gone even ten ri...</i>
      </p>
      <p>When the song subsides, the woman says, <q>Let us now hold a minute's silence for the deceased.</q> The hubbub of a crowd of thousands dies down as instantaneously as if someone had pressed a mute button, and the silence it leaves in its wakes seems shockingly stark. <a>You</a> get to <a>your</a> feet to observe the minute's silence, then walk up the steps to the main doors, on half of which has been left open. <a>you</a> get <a>your</a> surgical mask out from <a>your</a> trouser pocket and put it on.</p>
      <p>
         <i>These candles are no use at all.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
         <a>You</a> step into the gym hall, fighting down the wave of nausea that hits <a>you</a> with the stench. It's the middle of the day, but the dim interior is more like eveving's dusky half-light. The coffins that have already been through the memorial service have been grouped neatly near the door, while at the foot of the large window, each covered with a white cloth, lie the bodies of thirty two people for whom no relatives have yet arrived to put them in their coffins. Next to each of their heads, a candle wedged into an empty drinks bottle flickers quietly.</p>
      <p>
         <a>You</a> walk farther into the auditorium, toward the row of seven corpses that have been laid out to one side. Whereas the others have their cloths pulled up only to their throats, almost as though they are sleeping, these are all fully covered. Their faces are revealed only occasionally, when someonoe comes looking for a young girl or a baby. The sight of them is too cruel to be inflicted otherwise.</p>
      <p>
         <a>You</a> come back to the table by the door to get some new candles from the box, then return to the body in the corner. <a>You</a> light the cloth wicks of the new candle from the melted stub guttering by the corpse. Once the flame catches, <a>you</a> blow out the dying candle and remove it from the glass bottle, then insert the new one in its place, careful no to burn <a>yourself</a>.</p>
      <p>At first, the bodies had been housed not in the gymnasium, but in the corridor of ther complaints department in the <a>Provincial Office</a>. There were two women, both a few years older than <a>you</a>, one wearing a wide-collared school uniform and the other in ordinary clothes. <a>You</a> stared blankly, forgetting for a moment why <a>you</a>'d come, as they wiped the bloodied faces with a damp cloth and struggled to straighten the stiff arms, to force them down by the corpses' sides.</p>
      <p>
         <q>Can I help <a>you</a>?</q> the woman in school uniform asked, pulling her mask down below her mouth as she turned to face <a>you</a>. Her round eyes were her best feature, though ever-so-slightly protruding, and her hair was divided into two braids, from which a mass of short, frizzy hair was divided into two braids, from which a mass of short, frizzy haris were escaping. Damp with sweat, her hair was plastered to her forehead and temples.</p>
      <p>
         <q>
            <a>I</a>'m looking for a <a>friend</a>,</q>
         <a>you</a> said, holding out the hand that <a>you</a>'d been using to cover <a>your</a> nose, unused to the stench of blood.</p>
      <p>
         <q>Did <a>you</a> arrange to meet here?</q>
      </p>
      <p>
         <q>No, <a>he</a>'s one of those...</q>
      </p>
      <p>
         <q>I see, <a>you</a> can come and have a look, if <a>you</a> like.</q>
      </p>
      <p>
         <a>You</a> systematically examined the faces and bodies of the twenty-odd people lying against the corridor wall. <a>You</a> had to look closely if <a>you</a> wanted to be sure;<a>your</a> eyes soon started to feel the strain, and <a>you</a> had to keep blinking to try and refocus.</p>
      <p>
         <q>Not here?</q> the other woman asked, straightening up. She had the sleeves of her pale green shirt rolled up to the elbows. <a>You</a>'d assumed she was a similar age to the young woman in school uniform; seeing her without the mask on, though, you could see she was older, more like twenty. Her skin was somewhat sallow, and she had a slender, delicate neck. Only the look in her eyes was tough and vigorous. And there was nothing feeble about her voice.</p>
      <p>
         <q>No.</q>
      </p>
      <p>
         <q>Have <a>you</a> tried the mortuary at <a>Jeonnam</a>, and the one at the <a>Red Cross Hospital</a>?</q>
      </p>
      <p>
         <q>Yes.</q>
      </p>
      <p>
         <q>What about this <a>friend</a>'s parents</q>
      </p>
      <p>
         <q>
            <a>His</a> mother passed away, and <a>his</a> father works in <a>Daejeon</a>; <a>he</a> lives in our annex with <a>his</a> older sister.</q>
      </p>
      <p>
         <q>They still won't put long-distance calls through?</q>
      </p>
      <p>
         <q>No, and <a>I</a>'ve tried a few times.</q>
      </p>
      <p>
         <q>Well, what about your <a>friend</a>'s sister?</q>
      </p>
      <p>
         <q>She hasn't been home since Sunday; <a>I</a> came here to look for her, too. One of our neighbors said they saw my <a>friend</a> get hit yesterday when the soldiers were shooting.</q>
      </p>
      <p>
         <q>Mightn't <a>he</a> just have been wounded and admitted to <a>hospital</a>?</q> the woman in school uniform interjected, without looking up.</p>
      <p>
         <a>You</a> shook <a>your</a> head.</p>
      <p>
         <q>In that case <a>he</a> would have found a way to call us. <a>He</a>'d know we were worrying about him.</q>
      </p>
      <p>
         <q>Come by again tomorrow, and the next couple of days,</q> said the woman in the pale green shirt. <q>Apparently all the dead will be brought here from now on. They say there's no room left in the morgues.</q>
      </p>
      <p>The woman in school uniform wiped the face of a yound man whose throat had been sliced open by a bayonet, his red uvula poking out. She brushed the palm of her hand down over his staring eyes, closing them, rinsed the cloth in a bucket of water, and wrung it out viciously. The water that came out was dark with blood, splattering outside the bucket. The woman in the green shirt stood up.</p>
      <p>
         <q>How about <a>you</a> give us a hand, if <a>you</a> have time?</q> she asked. <q>Just for today. We don't have enough people. It's not difficult... <a>you</a> just need to cut up that cloth over there and use it to cover the bodies. And when someone comes looking for a friend like <a>you</a> did, <a>you</a> uncover them again. The faces are badly injured, so they'll need to get a good look at their bodies and clothes to decide whether it's who they think it is.</q>
